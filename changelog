# Version 0.7.0

* Add Lazy version of "toSocket*".

# Version 0.6.3

* Bump `network-simple`, `transformers` and `pipes-safe` upper bounds.

* Remove `Base m ~ IO` constraints from `Pipes.Network.TCP.Safe`, as
  not all of them were removed in 0.6.1.


# Version 0.6.2

* Dependency bumps (upper bounds).


# Version 0.6.1

* Remove the `Base m ~ IO` constraint from `Pipes.Network.TCP.Safe`


# Version 0.6.0

* Significantly upgraded the API and renamed functions to play well with
  pipes-4.0.0, pipes-safe-2.0.0 and network-simple-0.3.0.

* Throw `IOError` in `IO` in order to report timeout errors. Delete
  the `Timeout` data-type.


# Version 0.5.1.0

* Re-export `Network.Socket.withSocketsDo`.

* Use TCP `send` and `recv` as eported by network-simple-0.2.1.0.


# Version 0.5.0.0

* Removed `Control.Proxy.TCP.Sync` and `Control.Proxy.TCP.Safe.Sync`.


# Version 0.4.0.1

* FIX: `acceptFork` now properly closes the connection socket, even in
  case of asynchronous exceptions.


# Version 0.4.0.0

* Do not handle “Broken Pipe” errors on the `*Write*D` proxies anymore.
  As as a result, those proxies run forever and have a polymorphic
  return value, which makes this release binary compatible with 0.2.0.0,
  but not with 0.3.0.0.


# Version 0.3.0.0

* Quietly stop writing or reading bytes from a TCP socket if a
  “Broken Pipe” error happens, indicating that the remote end
  already closed the connection. Previously, a `ResourceVanished`
  exception was thrown.

* All the `*Write*D` proxies now return `()` if the remote end
  closed the connection.


# Version 0.2.0.0

* Depend on network-simple 0.2

* In both modules `Control.Proxy.TCP` and `Control.Proxy.TCP.Safe`:
  `serveFork` was renamed to `serve` and the previous function named
  `serve` was removed.


# Version 0.1.1.0

* Split many of the non-pipes-related TCP utilities to the own
  `network-simple` package.
* Depend on `network-simple` and re-export its functions.


# Version 0.1.0.1

* Dependency bumps.


# Version 0.1.0

* New backwards incompatible API
* Based on pipes 3.1


# Up to version 0.0.2

* Based on pipes-core.
