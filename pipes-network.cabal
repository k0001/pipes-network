description:
  Use network sockets together with the @pipes@ library.
  .
  This package is organized using the following namespaces:
  .
  * "Pipes.Network.TCP" exports pipes and utilities for using TCP connections in
  a streaming fashion.
  .
  * "Pipes.Network.TCP.Safe" subsumes "Pipes.Network.TCP", exporting pipes and
  functions that allow you to safely establish new TCP connections within a
  pipeline using the @pipes-safe@ facilities. You only need to use this module
  if you want to safely acquire and release operating system resources within a
  pipeline.
  .
  See the @changelog@ file in the source distribution to learn about any
  important changes between version.
