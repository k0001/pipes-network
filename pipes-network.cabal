description:
  Use network sockets together with the @pipes@ library.
  .
  This package is organized using the following namespaces:
  .
  * "Pipes.Network.TCP" exports pipes and functions for
  establishing and using TCP connections.
  .
  * "Pipes.Network.TCP.Safe" is similar to "Pipes.Network.TCP", except
  the exported pipes themselves can obtain new network
  resources safely by using the facilities providied by the @pipes-safe@
  package.
  .
  See the @NEWS@ file in the source distribution to learn about any
  important changes between version.
