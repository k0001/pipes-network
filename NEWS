# Version 0.4.0.1

* FIX: `acceptFork` now properly closes the connection socket, even in
  case of asynchronous exceptions.


# Version 0.4.0.0

* Do not handle “Broken Pipe” errors on the `*Write*D` proxies anymore.
  As as a result, those proxies run forever and have a polymorphic
  return value, which makes this release binary compatible with 0.2.0.0,
  but not with 0.3.0.0.


# Version 0.3.0.0

* Quietly stop writing or reading bytes from a TCP socket if a
  “Broken Pipe” error happens, indicating that the remote end
  already closed the connection. Previously, a `ResourceVanished`
  exception was thrown.

* All the `*Write*D` proxies now return `()` if the remote end
  closed the connection.


# Version 0.2.0.0

* Depend on network-simple 0.2

* In both modules `Control.Proxy.TCP` and `Control.Proxy.TCP.Safe`:
  `serveFork` was renamed to `serve` and the previous function named
  `serve` was removed.


# Version 0.1.1.0

* Split many of the non-pipes-related TCP utilities to the own
  `network-simple` package.
* Depend on `network-simple` and re-export its functions.


# Version 0.1.0.1

* Dependency bumps.


# Version 0.1.0

* New backwards incompatible API
* Based on pipes 3.1


# Up to version 0.0.2

* Based on pipes-core.
